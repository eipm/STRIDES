# STRIDES Subscription Provisioning Process

**All Azure Subscriptions within a STRIDES enrollment must first be approved by the NIH**. This includes net-new subscriptions, administrative subscriptions, and existing subscriptions that are candidates to be migrated from a non-STRIDES enrollments into a STRIDES enrollment. 

The subscription process to seek approval is as follows:

| Task | Owner  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | Customer  | Complete [STRIDES Subscription Provisioning Request Form](assets/STRIDES%20Subscription%20Provisioning%20Template.xlsx), submit to [Microsoft STRIDES Team](mailto:MSSTRIDES@microsoft.com)|
| 2 | Microsoft | Complete request & submit to NIH STRIDES | 
| 3 | NIH | Review & Approve request |
| 4 | Customer | Create subscription, update form with subscription GUID, resubmit to Microsoft |
| 5 | Microsoft | Submit updated form to NIH STRIDES |

The template for the Subscription Provisioning Request Form [can be found here](assets/STRIDES%20Subscription%20Provisioning%20Template.xlsx). 

It is recommended that the customer utilize an ITSM or a utilitiy such as Microsoft Forms that will enable the creation of an online form to streamline the process. 

## Administrative Subscription Request
An administrative subscription is necessary to support the [STRIDES reporting requirements](../extramural%20reporting/README.md). Since the administrative subscription is not tied to a specific NIH project or grant, you must use the following values when submitting the request: 

| Field Name  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Program/Project Group**  | Admin Subscription  |
| **Requesting ICO**  | Blank  |
| **Funding Source**  | Blank  |
| **Funding Amount**  | Blank  |
| **Research Program**  | FALSE  |
| **Research / Work Topic**  | Admin Subscription  |
| **Research Keywords**  | Admin Subscription  |
